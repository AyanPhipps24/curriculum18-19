# Skills Day 3:

## Overview
The Professional Skills days are a time when students are able to demonstrate their technical and professional progress to Program Managers and Volunteers. Students will also have time to update their portfolios and participate in a team building activity. Professional Skills Days will happen 3 times throughout the advanced curriculum. This is a great opportunity to invite other people from your company to see what students have been working on and help guide students through whiteboarding exercises.
